# Object Oriented Trajtou Program

## Acknowledgement and citation
The current code is based on the works of F. Busnengo et al. [1] and subsequent uses of the Corrugation Reducing Procedure (CRP) method in gas-surface dynamics available in the bibliography.
This implementation adds a logistic function that controls the "amount" of CRP in the interpolation as a function of the distance of the projectile to the surface. If this code is used in any publishable study, it should include the reference: "A. S. Muzas, M. del Cueto, F. Gatti, M. F. Somers, G. J. Kroes, F. Mart√≠n and C. Diaz, Phys. Rev. B 96 205432 (2017)". That was the first paper in which our particular modified CRP method was described in detail.

## Brief functionality
1. Program for **PES** interpolation using the **CRP method**.
2. It can carry out **classical hamiltonian dynamics simulations**, adapted to scattering processes on **periodic surfaces**.
3. As the CRP method is only applicable to **monoatomic and diatomic projectiles**, the dynamics integrator has been implemented only for these two cases.
4. Currently, the code can only deal with p4mm wallpaper symmetry surfaces. However, new symmetries can be implemented easily due to the modular form of the code.

## Installation
1. Execute install.sh script and follow the instructions. You may edit that script to add new compiler compatibilities.

## Contact
As many other research-oriented codes produced during a PhD., OOP_trajtou lacks a concise documentation. Luckily, there is a lot of comments in doxygen format that could guide a potential user, but if that is not enough, I am glad to help. Contact me at albertopsmuzas@gmail.com.
